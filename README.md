I started by installing VS Code and setting up a new folder for the project.  
I created 3 pages — index.html, about.html, and contact.html — and connected Bootstrap 5 via CDN.  
Then I explored the official Bootstrap 5 documentation and example templates.  
I selected some components like Navbar, Cards, and Hero sections, and customized them to build my own layout.  

I used GitHub for version control, pushed the project, and hosted it using GitHub Pages.  
During the process, I referred to Bootstrap’s official examples and made sure my pages were responsive on both mobile and desktop.  

*Challenges faced:*  
- Understanding GitHub publishing for the first time.  
- Managing responsiveness of some sections.  

*What I learned:*  
- How to use Bootstrap 5 effectively for modern UI.  
- How to publish a website using GitHub Pages.  
- Improved understanding of HTML/CSS structure.  

*Time taken:* Around 4–5 hours in total.
